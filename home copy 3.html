        The Risk of Christ
    </h2>
  
     Jesus offers us eternal life, and He defined the risk we all must take to accept His offer in Matthew 16 (KJV):24  Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. 26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?The real risk, Jesus says, is losing our soul. That is the real risk we all must face in this life. Is gaining the whole world really worth it? Is doing our own thing really worth it if we lose our soul? And what will you give in exchange for your soul? Or what is your soul worth? Is it not worth everything you possess, even your whole heart and very life?No other risk even comes close to the risk of losing our own soul. This is the greatest risk anyone can take. We don’t have to take that risk. We can say yes to Jesus right now and receive eternal life. Jesus offers us eternal life as we read in John 3 (KJV):16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.Can it be that simple? We just believe in Him and we have eternal life? Jesus also said the same in John 5 (KJV):24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.This is the Gospel message. If you believe in the Son, you have eternal life. Jesus also points out the risk as we read in John 3 (KJV):36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them.What is it we must believe about the Son to receive eternal life? Paul the apostle tells us in Romans 10 (KJV):8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.This is a risk I admit. When I first read this, it seemed too good to be true. I wondered how could I know if it's true. I told God, "I have to hear from You." If it's true I reasoned, "God, You are big enough that You can get in touch with me and let me know in a way that I could know without a shadow of a doubt." 

 <br /> 
  <br />
Now Jesus said in John 7 (KJV):17 If any man will do his will, he shall 
 <br /> 
know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
 <br /> 
  <br />
I believe that what Jesus is saying is that we can know the truth if we are willing to let God show us. This is where the risk of Christ comes in. We have to be willing to hear from Him. Why would we not be willing? 
We might feel that we would lose our freedom to make our own choices, the choices that we want to make, if we were willing to hear from God. Or we might feel that our friends or our family might not agree and so reject us. 
Or we might feel that we would have to be under the control of the church if we were to hear from God. There are a thousand and one excuses we could come up with why we wouldn’t be willing to hear from Him. 
But if we want to be real, we know that we must at least give Him the chance to speak to us. This is what I did. I told God that I was willing to hear from Him if He would only speak to me in a way that I could be real and know
it was Him. I didn’t want to pretend He was God. I didn’t want to just go through the motions, the ritual of going to church.
