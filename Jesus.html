        <h1>Jesus Christ</h1>
<h1>Who is this Jesus?</h1>
	In the Gospels, we read about a man who wanted people to have everlasting life as we see in John 4(KJV):14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
</br>
</br>
	In this same Gospel, we hear Jesus tell Nicodemus that God loves the world so much that He gave His own Son so that we might have everlasting life as we read in John 3(KJV):34 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
</br>
</br>
  In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus also said that He came to do certain things as we read in Luke 14(KJV):17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,

18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,

19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.

21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.	
 </br>
</br>
Jesus seems to be on a mission to heal the brokenhearted, to set captives free, and to proclaim that today is a new day! 
 </br>
</br>
It seems that Jesus saw Himself as the one the prophet Isaiah, who lived between 740 and 680 B.C., was speaking of in the book of Isaiah where we read Isaiah 61(KJV):1 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;

2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;
 </br>
</br>

It is clear in the Gospel of John that Jesus also thought Himself to be God’s Son as we read in John 10(KJV):24 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.

25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.

26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.

27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:

28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

30 I and my Father are one. 
 </br>
</br>
When Jesus said that He and His Father were one, the Jews understood Him to mean that He was God as we continue reading in John 10(KJV):31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.

32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?

33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.

34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?

35 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;

36 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?
  </br>
</br>
Jesus did not deny that He was God, but explained also that He was God’s Son, and that the works of miracles that He did testified to this as we continue to read in John 10(KJV):37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.

39 Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,

40 And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.

41 And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.

42 And many believed on him there. 
   
<p>Jesus also said that He was the way, the truth, and the life in John 14(KJV):6 “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</p>

Have you ever known anyone in the history of mankind to say that they are the truth? Certainly Jesus was compassionate, and of a tender heart. But what did He mean that He was the truth?	  
  </br>
</br>
I think it has something to do with His trustworthiness. Jesus wanted us to know we can trust Him.
